defmodule Hayago.Game do
  @moduledoc """
  A struct to describe the game's history, and functions to progress the game.

  ## Attributes

  ### History

  The *history* attribute contains a list of `Hayago.State` structs, where the
  first element in the list is the current state. Whenever a move is made, a
  new state is prepended to the list. The history attbibute initally holds a
  single empty State to represent the empty board.

  ### Index

  The *index* represents the current index in the history list. On
  initialization, the index is 0, as the current state is the first element in
  the history list. To jump back one turn, the index is increased to 1. The
  `state/1` function uses the index to get the state that corresponds to the
  index.

  Returns the element in the history list that corresponds to the `:index`

  Places a new stone on the board by prepending a new state to the history. The
  new state is created by calling `Hayago.State.place/2` and passing the
  current state, and the position passed to `place/2`.

  first, which returns true if the current player can place a stone their
  without it being immediately captured.
